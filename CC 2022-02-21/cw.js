// Your function takes two arguments:

// current father's age (years)
// current age of his son (years)

// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

let twiceAsOld = (dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) => Math.abs(dadYearsOld - 2 * sonYearsOld)

console.log(twiceAsOld(30, 7))
console.log(twiceAsOld(30,17))
